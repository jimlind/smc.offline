Offline Comic Viewer for StashMyComics
Developed by @JimLindForPope

INTRODUCTION

Building an app that works in all the platforms is a fools game.
Here is an HTML5 app that keeps everything in a format that'll work great when
your device is offline as well.

INSTALLATION

There are two bits that keep this from being a complete JS solution.
#1 - XSS browser protection
	JS can't download files from a different server
#2 - MIME types
	appcache files need to be served as text/cache-manifest MIME type

To solve the cross-site scripting problem you need to have a file on the same
machine that can download files from StashMyComics for you.  I built one in PHP
that is included here as 'smcScrape.php' so just keep that intact for your
properly configured LAMP stack server.

To solve the MIME type problem you need to setup your server with a slightly
different configuration.  If your LAMP stack server is properly configured the
included '.htaccess' file will take care of it.  Without that file the app won't
work offline.

TESTED

I've tested this on the latest Chrome and an iPad since that's what I use.  If
you have another browser/device and want support feel free to fork my repo.
